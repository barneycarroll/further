## Ambition
A display type face for the Roman alphabet inspired by Nordic runes and the more modern-style art-nouveau letter work, rooted in the consistent tall regular staves and lightness of shape of futhark, deviating in the representation of futhark twigs by relying on a minimal set of consistent curves in the Nouveau style — eschewing serifs — with an emphasis on clean lines, resourceful use of a limited set of curves paths, consistent weighting of glyphs and a light register.

## Method
Describe the set of essential lines and curves as SVG paths and compose the glyphs as an SVG font, then compile to more adopted formats using scripts.

## Status
Embryonic
